    "The purpose of this code is to reproject/regrid an image. \n",
    "That means changing the WCS of one fits to that of another\n",
    "and also changing the pixel scale or resolution to that of another (likely lower-res)\n",

    "The general structure of this code is that the first half runs through a bulk list of Spitzer and Hubble images\n",
    "and reprojects them onto a low-res Spitzer image. Before running the code, you will need to see im_conv first \n",
    "and set up a similar method of reading in wavelengths.\n",

    "The detailed steps of how this works as Dan explained...\n",
    "Convolution theorem: we have an image and a PSF (e.g. a Gaussian or a sinc func)\n",
    "2D Fourier transf them, multiply them, 2D FT the result back. \n",
    "Can use FFT routines built into libraries (EX: astropy). \n",
    "May have to alias power down to an order that will reappear. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PSF can either be from lambda / D b/c we’re not diffraction limited. Can also measure it from background stars \n",
    "\n",
    "Often people first figure out the spatial resolution of each image. \n",
    "Say you have 0.2” and 9” for two images. \n",
    "Take the low res image, convolve with the high res PSF. \n",
    "Take the high res image, convolve with the low res PSF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then have to regrid the images to conserve flux and energy on the same grid. \n",
    "Usually the final grid you want to have is usually that of the final image. \n",
    "For each point on the sky, you normally need to generate a set of artificial pixels with the orientation you want (from the WCS)\n",
    "and reorient all your pixels to the same spacing and pixel width. \n",
