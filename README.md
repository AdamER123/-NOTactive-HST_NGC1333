Initial PhD work advised by professor Dan M Watson at University of Rochester. The data are available on MAST but are difficult to align because the telescope was in "DASH" mode (drifting and shifting - a concept introduced by Ivelina Momcheva for galactic studies which I showed was more difficult with fewer guide stars)

ImageProcessing: Main work I did, including studying the spatial PSF of the images, statistically studying emission lines and atomic properties, and modeling continuum when unvailable.

Shock_Model_Codes: Work with and advising undergraduates. Updated code, commented, and made functions more flexible for taking different inputs and different datasets.
